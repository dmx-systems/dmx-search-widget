    * Change license to `AGPL-3.0`

**0.24** -- May 28, 2019

**0.22** -- Apr 1, 2019

* Chore: bump dependency version numbers to snapshots

**0.21** -- Jan 29, 2019

* Improvements:
    * Show icons for the "Create" menu's special items

**0.20** -- Dec 21, 2018

**0.18** -- Oct 21, 2018

* Return to no-tabs layout

**0.17** -- Oct 6, 2018

**0.16** -- Sep 30, 2018

* New component prop `createEnabled` controls whether the "Create" tab is enabled

**0.15** -- Aug 22, 2018

* Composability:
    * The component emits events instead of dispatching into the host application. Events and their args:
        * `topic-reveal`  topic
        * `topic-create`  {topicType, value}
        * `extra-create`  {extraItem, value, optionsData}
        * `close`         -
    * The component receives app state via props instead of maintaining a Vuex store module on its own.
        * No Vuex dependency anymore

**0.14** -- Aug 18, 2018

* Pass widget `pos` to extra menu item `create` callback
* Fix: process directives on create-topic

**0.10** -- Mar 25, 2018

* New concept: the extra menu items can provide a "Create Options Component" to solicit further data from the user before creating the topic.
* Dependencies: `dm5-topic-list` replaces `el-table` as the result list component. Build size decreases by 100 KiB!

**0.9** -- Mar 22, 2018

* New option `topicHandler` replaces `auxAction`. Allows the handler and the `openSearchWidget` call to exist in the same closure.
